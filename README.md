Deletes Twitter from your server. Fights Democratic erosion.

This bot deletes all messages with links starting with https://twitter.com or https://x.com. Additionally, this bot runs an AI model to detect if an image is a screenshot of Twitter. The AI model has over a 93% accuracy rate. No stone shall be left unturned.

This bot is designed to enable a platform for non-fascist conversation and reduce the volume of brain rot in a server. The bot does not act to punish users who send Twitter links, nor does it notify them that their message was deleted. The bot requires admin permissions to run.

The bot can be added via this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1359731901576904824
